        <p><strong>Title:</strong> Air Pollution Modelling and Source Inference using the Advection Gaussian Process Framework</p>
        <p>This project applied a cutting-edge probabilistic model â€” the Advection Gaussian Process (Advection GP) â€” to infer pollution sources from real-world satellite and meteorological data. 
        While the model had previously only been tested on synthetic data, my dissertation explored its effectiveness in a real case study: the 2019â€“2020 Australian bushfires.</p>
        <p>The project involved substantial data wrangling, geospatial processing, and adapting the modelling pipeline to real-world uncertainties. It was awarded a <strong>Distinction (75)</strong>.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Key Contributions:</strong></p>
        <ul class="text-left">
          <li>Adapted a research-level Gaussian Process model to work with real satellite and wind data.</li>
          <li>Converted satellite-derived Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) data to approximate ground-level PM2.5 concentrations.</li>
          <li>Explored the impact of vertical transport by comparing 2D vs 3D wind field integration.</li>
          <li>Preprocessed NASA MERRA-2 reanalysis data and managed its limitations in resolution and accuracy.</li>
          <li>Handled spatial referencing using geospatial projection systems (cartography).</li>
          <li>Built custom workflows to interpolate wind data for particle-based source inference simulations.</li>
          <li>Validated results against satellite fire anomaly data from the 2019â€“2020 bushfires.</li>
          <li>Documented challenges with model uncertainty, altitude effects, and computational performance on limited hardware.</li>
        </ul>
