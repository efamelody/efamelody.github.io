- **Gazebo Simulator**
- **Python**
- **Linux (Ubuntu WSL)**
- **Git**
- **TurtleBot3 Waffle Pi**

# Assignment #2 – Autonomous Robot Control & Navigation  
**Team 52 – University Robotics Project**

This project involved designing, developing, and deploying robot behaviours for a TurtleBot3 Waffle Pi using the Robot Operating System (ROS). We worked in a small team and completed both simulated and real-world tasks across two parts of the assignment.

---

## 📦 Part A: Basic Robot Behaviours  
**Submission Deadline**: 15 March 2024  
Assessed using a real robot in the robotics lab.

### ✅ Tasks:
- **Task 1: Velocity Control** (10%)
  - Programmed the robot to follow a target velocity with smooth acceleration.
- **Task 2: Obstacle Avoidance** (20%)
  - Used LIDAR sensor data to navigate around dynamic obstacles in real time.
- **"Out-of-the-Box" Submission** (10%)
  - Delivered a plug-and-play ROS package with tested launch files and documentation.

---

## 🧠 Part B: Autonomy & Exploration  
**Submission Deadline**: 17 May 2024  
Task 3 tested in simulation, Task 4 on real robot hardware.

### ✅ Tasks:
- **Task 3: Maze Navigation** (20%)
  - Developed a state machine in C++ to guide the robot through a complex maze.
- **Task 4: Exploration & Beacon Search** (40%)
  - Implemented autonomous frontier-based exploration.
  - Added a colour-based target detection system to capture images of specific beacons using ROS parameters (`target_colour:={red|blue|green|yellow}`).
  - Integrated camera feeds and image capture logic for beacon detection.

## 🚀 Key Features & Implementation

- **Robust Launch File Structure**:  
  Each task included a dedicated `roslaunch` configuration:
  - `roslaunch com2009_team52 task1.launch`
  - `roslaunch com2009_team52 task2.launch`
  - `roslaunch com2009_team52 task3.launch`
  - `roslaunch com2009_team52 task4.launch target_colour:=red`

- **Peer Collaboration**:  
  Participated in structured peer evaluations at multiple stages using Buddycheck. Emphasis on teamwork, version control, and review cycles.

- **Real Robot Safety Compliance**:  
  Completed health and safety training for real robot operation, ensuring safe hardware handling in lab environments.

# Installation

To test locally:
1. Extract the `.tar` ROS package.
2. Build using `catkin_make` in a ROS workspace.
3. Run tasks via `roslaunch`, ensuring appropriate simulation or robot hardware is connected.
