# Features

## Chessboard Diagram Classifier
A Python-based classifier for chessboard diagrams that employs Nearest Neighbour and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction.

### Key Highlights
- **Feature Extraction**: Implemented advanced feature extraction techniques, providing clear justifications for the chosen methods in the accompanying report.
- **Classification Methods**: Enhanced classification methods through rigorous experimentation and analysis, resulting in improved accuracy and robustness.
- **Independent Square and Full-Board Classification**: Successfully created two versions of the classifier, achieving 98% accuracy on both clean and noisy datasets.

### Implementation Details
- **Nearest Neighbour**: Utilized the Nearest Neighbour algorithm to classify chessboard diagrams based on extracted features.
- **PCA**: Employed PCA to reduce dimensionality and improve computational efficiency, facilitating better performance in classification tasks.
